everyday steps

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch for a feature

📂 Where to Keep Notes / Ideas

Use docs/ folder for planning:

docs/
│── roadmap.md        # Weekly tasks
│── api-design.md     # Bot API + webhook structure
│── db-schema.md      # Mongo models
│── ui-wireframes.md  # Screenshots or notes for frontend


Commit these too — GitHub will serve as your single source of truth.
